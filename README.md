# React_Travel_Tour
It is React Based Project in which I have used the cocnept of Grid anf Flex Styles for CSS designing.
There are different cities I had appended in map. I am extracting map values one by one. The buttons are dynamic ... when user will click the button "Not Intrested" the card will disappear.

Steps to start the Project:-
1. Npm i

Note:- if React Script is not added in your json file add by below command:
npm i starter-react-component
